This is my shaders and graphics pipeline polygon. The latest my experiment was to integrate Gerstner waves ocean with plenty of graphical effects such as SSS approximation, simple bloom and SSR support. Also trying to make a bridge between CPU and GPU in physics simulations. Full BRP Forward render pipeline.
